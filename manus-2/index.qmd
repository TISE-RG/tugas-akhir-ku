# Introduction

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

See @knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.


Modern scientific and engineering communication benefits from a **blend of media**:  
plots produced by code, structural diagrams, numerical tables, mathematical equations, and illustrative images.  

In this short essay we demonstrate how a Quarto document can integrate:

- a Python-generated plot (@fig-sine),
- a Mermaid diagram (@fig-flow),
- a data table (@tbl-stats),
- a mathematical equation with a label (@eq-gauss),
- and an external picture (@fig-photo).

Each element is encapsulated in its own block, given a caption, and cross-referenced in the text.



# 1. Python Plots for Quantitative Insight

Numerical phenomena are often best understood visually.  
In @fig-sine, we use a Python code block to generate a simple plot of a sine wave and its noisy variant.  
This kind of plot is typical in courses on signals and systems, time-series analysis, and scientific computing.

```{python}
#| label: fig-sine
#| fig-cap: "Sine wave and noisy observation generated using Python and Matplotlib."
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate data
t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 200)
x = np.sin(t)
noise = 0.2 * np.random.randn(len(t))
y = x + noise

# Create plot
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, x, label="Clean sine x(t)")
plt.plot(t, y, ".", label="Noisy samples y(t)")
plt.xlabel("t (radians)")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
```

The code in @fig-sine not only produces a figure but also documents the process.
Because it lives in the same document as the explanation, it strongly supports reproducible research.



# 2. Mermaid Diagrams for Conceptual Structure

While Python plots excel at quantitative views, **Mermaid diagrams** provide concise visualizations of **conceptual flows and system structure**.

In @fig-flow we use a Mermaid flowchart to represent a simple data-processing pipeline, echoing the kind of workflow that might use the data generated in @fig-sine.

:::{#fig-flow}
```{mermaid}

    A[Raw Data] --> B[Preprocessing]
    B --> C[Modeling]
    C --> D[Evaluation]
    D --> E[Report & Visualization]
```

The structure in @fig-flow complements the numerical view in @fig-sine:
one shows *what the data look like*, the other shows *what we do with the data*.



# 3. Tables for Compact Numerical Summaries

Sometimes a **compact tabular summary** is more useful than a figure.
In @tbl-stats we compute basic statistics from the same sine–noise data used in @fig-sine.
Here we rely on Python again, but this time the result is rendered as a table instead of a plot.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-stats
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics for the clean signal x(t) and noisy observation y(t)."
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

stats = {
    "series": ["x(t) clean", "y(t) noisy"],
    "mean": [np.mean(x), np.mean(y)],
    "std": [np.std(x), np.std(y)],
    "min": [np.min(x), np.min(y)],
    "max": [np.max(x), np.max(y)]
}

df_stats = pd.DataFrame(stats)
df_stats
```

The table @tbl-stats complements @fig-sine by giving numerical values for mean, standard deviation, and range.
Together they allow the reader to both **see** and **measure** the effect of noise on the signal.



# 4. Equations for Analytical Foundations

Behind the numerical experiments in @fig-sine and the workflow in @fig-flow lies a rich **analytical foundation**.
Equations provide a precise language for expressing models and assumptions.

For example, the well-known **Gaussian probability density function** can be written as:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}
\exp!\left(
-,\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}
\right)
$${#eq-gauss}

Equation @eq-gauss is frequently used to model noise such as the perturbations added to the sine wave in @fig-sine.
By referring directly to @eq-gauss in the text, we connect the **mathematical model**, the **simulation code**, and the **visual outputs** in a single narrative.



# 5. Images for Context and Intuition

Finally, **photographs and other images** can add context, intuition, or aesthetic value that diagrams and equations alone cannot provide.
Consider @fig-photo, which you might imagine as an illustration of a data-collection setting (for instance, a sensor observing a natural environment).

> **Note:** Replace the file path below (`images/mountains.jpg`) with any real image in your project directory.

![Illustrative photograph suggesting a measurement environment, e.g., sensors observing a physical system.](images/mountains.jpg){#fig-photo}

Figure @fig-photo can be used to anchor the abstract discussion of signals, systems, and models in a concrete, physical setting.
The same document thus ties together **real-world context** (@fig-photo), **system structure** (@fig-flow), **data behavior** (@fig-sine), **numerical summaries** (@tbl-stats), and **analytical formulas** (@eq-gauss).



# Conclusion

In this essay we have demonstrated how a single Quarto document can blend:

* **Python plots** for numerical intuition (@fig-sine),
* **Mermaid diagrams** for conceptual workflows (@fig-flow),
* **Tables** for compact quantitative summaries (@tbl-stats),
* **Equations** for mathematical rigor (@eq-gauss),
* **Images** for real-world context (@fig-photo).

By encapsulating each element in a block with a caption and cross-referencing it from the text, Quarto encourages **coherent, literate, and reproducible** technical writing.

The same pattern can be extended to larger projects: lecture notes, research articles, technical reports, or even books—always keeping **code, narrative, and visuals** in one unified, executable manuscript.
