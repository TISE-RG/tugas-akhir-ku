# Introduction

Graphviz provides exceptional power for expressing structures, flows, and relationships.  
This essay demonstrates ten of the most useful Graphviz diagram types, each shown in figures such as the simple block diagram in @fig-block and the hierarchical tree in @fig-tree.

Throughout the text, we reference diagrams using Quarto’s cross-referencing syntax (e.g., @fig-network, @fig-state), enabling clean academic writing.

---

# 1. Simple Signal–System Block Diagram

A minimal left-to-right block diagram is shown in @fig-block.

```{dot}
//| label: fig-block
//| fig-cap: "Simple Signal–System Block Diagram"
digraph G {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=none, fontname="Helvetica", fontsize=14];
  x[label="x(t)"];
  H[shape=box, style="rounded,filled", fillcolor=lightgrey, label="System H"];
  y[label="y(t)"];
  x -> H -> y;
}
````

# 2. Hierarchical Tree (Top-Down)

Graphviz excels at hierarchical structures, such as the organizational tree in @fig-tree.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-tree
#| fig-cap: "Hierarchical Tree Diagram (Top–Down)"
digraph Org {
  rankdir=TB;
  node [shape=box, style=rounded];
  CEO -> {CTO CFO COO};
  CTO -> {Engineering IT};
  CFO -> {Finance Accounting};
  COO -> {Operations Logistics};
}
```

---

# 3. Directed Workflow Diagram

The pipeline workflow in @fig-workflow shows a multi-stage process.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-workflow
#| fig-cap: "Directed Workflow Pipeline"
digraph Pipeline {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=box, style=rounded];
  A[label="Input"];
  B[label="Filtering"];
  C[label="Transformation"];
  D[label="Output"];
  A -> B -> C -> D;
}
```

---

# 4. Decision Diagram

A branching decision structure is presented in @fig-decision.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-decision
#| fig-cap: "Decision Diagram with Branching Paths"
digraph Decision {
  rankdir=TB;
  node [shape=diamond, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];
  D[label="Condition?"];
  node [shape=box, style=rounded, fillcolor=white];
  Yes[label="Proceed"];
  No[label="Stop"];
  D -> Yes [label="Yes"];
  D -> No  [label="No"];
}
```

---

# 5. Undirected Network Graph

Graphviz can model networks such as the undirected cluster in @fig-network.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-network
#| fig-cap: "Undirected Network Graph Showing Connections"
graph Network {
  node [shape=circle, style=filled, fillcolor=lightyellow];
  A -- B -- C -- D -- A;
  B -- E -- C;
}
```

---

# 6. State Machine Diagram

The state transition model in @fig-state illustrates system behavior.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-state
#| fig-cap: "Finite State Machine with Error Recovery"
digraph FSM {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=circle];
  Idle -> Running [label="start"];
  Running -> Idle [label="stop"];
  Running -> Error [label="fault"];
  Error -> Idle [label="reset"];
}
```

---

# 7. Clustered Graph (Subsystem Grouping)

Clustering helps show subsystems; see @fig-cluster.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-cluster
#| fig-cap: "Clustered Graph Showing Subsystems"
digraph Clustered {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=box];

  subgraph cluster_A {
    label="Subsystem A";
    style=filled;
    color=lightgrey;
    A1; A2; A3;
  }

  subgraph cluster_B {
    label="Subsystem B";
    style=filled;
    color=lightblue;
    B1; B2;
  }

  A1 -> B1;
  A2 -> B2;
}
```

---

# 8. Bipartite Graph

A classic bipartite structure is illustrated in @fig-bipartite.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-bipartite
#| fig-cap: "Bipartite Graph with Two Disjoint Node Sets"
graph Bipartite {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=circle];

  {rank=same; A1; A2; A3;}
  {rank=same; B1; B2;}

  A1 -- B1;
  A2 -- B1;
  A3 -- B2;
}
```

---

# 9. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

The DAG in @fig-dag is useful for tasks, scheduling, or dependencies.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-dag
#| fig-cap: "Directed Acyclic Graph for Dependency Modeling"
digraph DAG {
  rankdir=TB;
  node [shape=box, style=rounded];
  A -> B -> D;
  A -> C -> D;
  B -> E;
  C -> E;
}
```

---

# 10. Flow Network with Edge Capacities

Flow networks visualize constraints; the example is shown in @fig-flow.

```{dot}
#| label: fig-flow
#| fig-cap: "Flow Network with Edge Capacities"
digraph Flow {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=circle];
  A -> B [label="3"];
  A -> C [label="2"];
  B -> D [label="2"];
  C -> D [label="3"];
  B -> C [label="1"];
}
```

# Conclusion

These ten Graphviz examples—ranging from basic block diagrams (e.g., @fig-block) to sophisticated cluster graphs (@fig-cluster) and dependency DAGs (@fig-dag)—show how expressive DOT is when embedded in Quarto.

Graphviz offers clarity, precision, and automation that make it invaluable for engineering, system design, data modeling, and conceptual explanation.
